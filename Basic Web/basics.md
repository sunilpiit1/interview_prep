## BASIC WEB TERMINOLOGY

### INTERNET

Internet stands for interconnected-networks, basically represents an interconnection between computers all around the globe through which they can share resources. Also Internet governs that how these resources must be shared by implying some set of rules also known as protocols (ip, tcp/ip, udp, http, ftp, mtp, imap, pop are few examples of them).

There are multiple services that internet provides us like web, mailing and etc. and these services based on different-different protocols (like web works on http protocol)

### WEB

The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.

The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.

So basically Web is a service provided by the internet to serve web-pages, and it works on the http protocol and the computers that serves these web-pages are known as web-servers.
