## BASIC WEB TERMINOLOGY

### INTERNET

Internet stands for interconnected-networks, basically represents an interconnection between computers all around the globe through which they can share resources.

Internet also governs that how these resources must be shared by implying some set of rules also known as protocols (ip, tcp/ip, udp, http, ftp, mtp, imap, pop are few examples of them).

There are multiple services that internet provides us like for web-surfing, mailing, file-transfer etc. and these services based on different-different protocols (like web works on http protocol).

### WEB

The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by URLs (such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.

The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.

So basically Web is a service provided by the internet to serve web-pages or say web-surfing, it works on the http protocol and the computers that serves these web-pages are known as web-servers.

### URL

URL is one of the key concepts of the Web. It is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.

When you type a URL in browser and hit enter, Browser actually creates a request out of the URL and try to make connection to the server and get the resource for you. [Click to know more.]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL")

### HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response.

An application layer protocol actually sets rules on how the applications are going to talk to each other, basically how the structure of request and response will look like.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.[Click to know more]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP")

### WHAT IS HYPER TEXT AND HTML

Hypertext is text that contains links to other texts, as opposed to a single linear flow like in a novel.

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as head, title, body and many others.

### WEB-CLIENT (BROWSERS)

Web-clients are basically softwares with which we can request resources from web-servers, you can locate these resources by typing URL in the client/browsers.

Once you hit the URL your client will make a connection with the server and will get the resource for you the form of response object. Now your client/browser will read the content-type of the response wnd will act accordingly on the body of the response and will render it on the screen.

In response you might get multiple MIME types but most common are text/html, application/json, text/plain, xml, image/svg and many more.

### WEB-SERVERS

On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files)

On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).

### REQUEST AND RESPONSE

### API'S

### REST

### GRAPHQL

1. FTP
2. MTP
3. IMAP
4. POP
